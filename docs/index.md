# Welcome to RedCoffee

RedCoffee is a CLI Tool, developed and built using Python, that helps developers generate insightful PDF Reports for code analysis done using SonarQube Community Edition.

# Motivation behind building RedCoffee

While working on a collaborative side project in late 2022 and early 2023, my team decided to integrate SonarQube (Community Edition) to monitor and maintain code quality. Since the initiative was majorly was learning purpose, we opted for SonarQube Community edition. The SonarQube CE definitely offered us the Core Features that we needed, however, it came with it's own set of disadvantages like

* There was no in-built mechanism to export the PDF Report for the code analysis that has been done. 
* Our SonarQube Server was running locally via docker, making the integration less straight-forward.
* Lack of actively maintained plugin(s) to generate shareable and printable reports.

These challenges highlighted a clear gap in the SonarQube Community Edition EcoSystem and that's when RedCoffee was brewed.

RedCoffee is not the perfect solution but it should be enough to get the job done.
